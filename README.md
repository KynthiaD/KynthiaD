#### 👋 Hi, I’m Kynthia!

🔥 I may be in my 30s, but my love for coding has only aged like fine wine🍷 (or maybe just like a forgotten sandwich at the back of the fridge👀), ever since my first encounter with a computer (a very yellow-y Atari), at the spry age of 6 (according to my mother).

❌ No relevant work experience, but hey, we all start somewhere, right? Don't be fooled by my age; I've got more passion for programming than a kid in a candy store! 🍭🍬

🚀 Join me on this coding odyssey, and let's create digital masterpieces while we navigate the baffling world of software development together. 🌌

🤓 Drop me a message if you're ready to work with someone who's not afraid to admit they're still figuring things out, all while cracking the occasional programming joke. 🤪

🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript at Colt Steele's Udemy "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024"
